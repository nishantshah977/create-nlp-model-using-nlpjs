Nlp.js is an open-source natural language processing (NLP) library written in JavaScript. It provides a wide range of NLP tools and features that can be used to perform tasks such as tokenization, stemming, sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and more. The library is designed to be user-friendly and flexible, allowing developers to easily create and train custom NLP models using their own data. Nlp.js is built on top of Node.js and can be used in both browser-based and server-side applications. It has a large and active community of developers contributing to its ongoing development and improvement.
